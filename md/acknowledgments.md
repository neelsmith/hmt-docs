# CHS Technical Working Group #
The work documented here has been developed by Christopher Blackwell and Neel Smith, and has been made possible by the support of the Center for Hellenic Studies, and in particular its director, Gregory Nagy, and Lenny Muellner, Program Director of Publications and Information Technology at CHS.  This work particularly reflects our experience as project architects of the Homer Multitext project, and owes a special debt to the editors of the HMT project, Casey Du√© and Mary Ebbott.
